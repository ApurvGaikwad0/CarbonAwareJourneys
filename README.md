# CarbonAwareJourneys

CarbonAwareJourneys is a data-driven project designed to analyze and optimize travel patterns during festivals. By exploring the relationship between traffic congestion, emissions, and eco-consciousness, this project provides actionable insights to minimize the environmental impact of festival-related travel while promoting sustainable practices.

## Overview

Festival seasons often lead to increased traffic, higher emissions, and a significant environmental footprint. CarbonAwareJourneys addresses these challenges by leveraging data analytics and geospatial mapping to:
   Understand festival travel behaviors.
   Identify high-congestion areas and emission hotspots.
   Promote eco-conscious decisions for travelers and organizers.
   
This project was developed as part of the National Highways Digital Lab Step-Up Challenge, focusing on real-world solutions to reduce carbon footprints and support sustainable travel initiatives.

## Key Features

Emission Analysis: Evaluate the relationship between delays and emissions during festival journeys.
Cost Optimization: Calculate and analyze fare per mile and extra travel costs.
Eco-Consciousness Insights: Assess traveler awareness and adoption of sustainable practices.
Geospatial Mapping: Visualize congestion and emission hotspots using advanced geospatial tools.
Actionable Recommendations: Provide practical strategies to minimize environmental impact.
